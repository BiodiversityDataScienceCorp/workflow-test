This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for testing the workflow of branching and merging.

Here we search GBIF for records of _Lycaena xanthoides_ and display the 
results of the query.

```{r}
library(spocc)
species <- "Lycaena xanthoides"
gbif_query <- occ(query = species, 
                  from = "gbif",
                  limit = 10)
occ_df <- occ2df(gbif_query)
print(occ_df)
```
